      <h3>Assignment of Responsibility</h3>
      <p>Effective implementation of a RPP requires: 1) a designated person to oversee and coordinate programmatic functions; 2) the participation of frontline supervisors; and 3) each HCW will use a respirator.</p> 
      <p>1.  Respirator Program Administrator (RPA) - Within each facility, a person(s) should designated to oversee and administer the RPP. This individual should be suitably trained program administrator, who while does not have to be a health and safety professional, he/she must have expertise in the principles of respiratory protection.  This person will be assigned responsibility for administering and monitoring all aspects of the respiratory protection program, and should be knowledgeable about the national and other recommended respiratory protection standards. The RPA will provide guidance on procuring certified respirators; provide routine training to staff on how to use respirators; conduct and document fit testing and medical evaluations, monitor staff adherence to respirator policies and procedures; and maintain records and documentation for the overall program, as well as updating and evaluating the program as needed. </p>
      <p>2.  Frontline Supervisors should identify HCWs and tasks that require respirators, and communicate this information to the RPA. Supervisors also should be responsible for ensuring that their staff follow appropriate procedures for respirator use, including adherence with required trainings, evaluations, and fit testing.  HCWs should be permitted to attend to required aspects of the RPP a during their usual work hours. 
      All HCWs in the facility, including contractors and trainees, are responsible for their own respirators and should wear them in accordance with the facilityâ€™s policies and procedures.  HCWs also are responsible for informing their supervisor(s) if they have problem with their assigned respirator (e.g., ill fitting, respiratory difficulty, etc.), and participate in medical evaluations including the required questionnaires for medical clearance.<p>
