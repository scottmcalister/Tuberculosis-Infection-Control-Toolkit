      <h1>Respiratory Protection Module</h1><br>
      <h3>Selection of Respirators</h3>
      <p>The N95 (or the European equivalent FFP2) filtering facepiece or particulate respirator, is the most commonly used respirator in healthcare settings. In contrast to surgical masks, N95 particulate respirators remove 95% of the airborne particles and also create a tight facial seal that prevents the flow of airborne contaminants into the wearer’s breathing zone.</p>
      <p>Before procuring respirators for use with the facility, it’s important to make sure that the respirator selected for use is certified for the intended purpose. An up-to-date list of approved N-95 respirators is available at:  Knowits.niosh.gov. Certain features, such as the testing and certification (TC) number, can also help identify certified/approved respirators by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/">https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/</a> or <a href="http://knowits.NIOSH.gov">http://knowits.NIOSH.gov</a>.</p><br>
      <h4><b><u>Medical Evaluations</u></b></h4>
      <p>All HCWs who are required to wear a N95 respirator should first undergo and pass a medical evaluation by a physician or licensed healthcare provider.  Some HCWs may have medical conditions (e.g. COPD) that make it unsafe to wear a respirator. Medical evaluation may consist of a simple self-administered questionnaire to screen for pre-existing conditions (e.g.,  smoking history, cardiac or pulmonary conditions, vision/hearing issues,  musculoskeletal conditions) or use of a screening questionnaire in combination with a physical examination and other tests (e.g., ) as determined by the examining healthcare provider.  Medical evaluations should be provided at no cost to the HCW and at during the HCW’s normal work hours.</p>
      <p>In addition to the initial medical screening, a medical evaluation should be repeated if there is a change in the HCW’s health status (e.g.,) or work environment (e.g., work duties, use of other protective equipment, or temperature) that may impact their ability to safely use a respirator.  Also, the HCW should undergo medical evaluation whenever he/she reports symptoms related to respirator use (e.g.,  shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pains or wheezing). If contraindications to use or respirator complications occur, respirator use should be discontinued until the HCW is undergoes medical evaluation and is cleared to resume/continue respirator use.  HCWs who are not medically cleared to wear respirators should not be provided a respirator and should be assigned to work areas or duties that that do not require respirator use.</p>
      <p>Medical clearance for respirator use, including any restrictions or limitations on use should be documented in the HCWs occupational health records and a copy should be provided to the HCW and the RPA.  The worker should be allowed an opportunity to discuss the questionnaire and examination results with the physician or licensed healthcare professional.</p><br>
      <h4><b><u>Fit Testing</u></b></h4>
      <p>Fit testing is a necessary component of a respiratory protection program.  Fit testing is required to identify the appropriate model and size respirator for each HCW to ensure that the respirator fits properly and securely and does not impair breathing or obstruct the wearer’s sight. All respirators that rely on a mask-to-face seal must be fit tested to validate the seal is air-tight. Fit testing should be done:
        <li>prior to first issue,</li>
        <li>when there's a change in the model, style or size of respirator used,</li>
        <li>when there's a physical facial change in the person wearing the respirator, and</li>
        <li>at least annually</li><br>
      Fit testing should be repeated on an annual basis, as there might be changes in the HCW’s physical condition that can affect the respirator’s fit (e.g., changes in weight, dental work, facial scarring, etc.). There is no licensed certification required for someone to conduct fit testing – any individual can do so as long as they understand how to follow the protocol and are skilled at training people on how to perform a user seal check. However, it is the RPA’s responsibility to ensure that the person conducting fit testing is competent, and that this individual follows the protocol as written in the standard.</p><br>
      <p>There are two approved methods for respirator fit testing:  quantitative fit testing and qualitative fit testing. 
        <li>There are three types of quantitative fit tests, all of which and all require relatively expensive equipment, and provide an objective assessment of the respirator’s efficacy, eliminating any subjectivity that a qualitative test provides. Thus for lower-resource settings, qualitative fit testing might be a more preferable option. The most common quantitative protocol is the ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter (CNC) test, which provides an automatic calculation of the effectiveness fit or “fit factor” – the ratio of the concentration of microscopic particles in the ambient air to the concentration particles that leak into the respirator. The required fit factor for passing the test depends on the type of respirator used. Unlike a qualitative fit test, quantitative fit tests are not affected by the person's sense of smell, taste or sensitivity to irritant chemicals.</li>
        <li>A qualitiativequalitative fit test is a pass/fail test that relies on the HCWs  subjective sensory (taste, irritation, smell) response to a particular test agent, typically —saccharin (sweet-tasting) or Bitrex® (bitter-tasting) test aerosols. The qualitative fit test agent uses a person’s response to a sweet taste to detect leakage into the respirator while performing a series of exercises that simulate normal movements under possible work conditions.  Because these tests rely on the user’s subjective detection of leakage when challenged with a test agent, the HCW must be pre-screened to determine his/her ability to detect the specific test agent.</li>
