        <h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</b></h2>
        <p><p>Q. What is an N95 respirator? 
            <br>A. The N95 respirator, also known known as a filtering facepiece respirator, is an air-purifying respirator that has been certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

            <p>Q. What does an N95 respirator protect against? 
            <br>A. The N95 is designed to protect against particulate matter such as dust, fumes, mists, aerosols, and smoke. It is also effective against biological particles such as pollen, mold spores, bacteria, viruses, animal dander and allergens. It is effective against aerosolized droplets, in particular, smaller droplets which evaporate to form droplet nuclei. 

            <p>Q. What does an N95 respirator NOT protect against? 
            <br>A. The N95 is not effective against gases and vapors. Examples of gases include methane and carbon monoxide. Vapors may include chemicals such as organic solvents and formaldehyde. 

            <p>Q. What does the N in N95 stand for? 
            <br>A. Particulate respirators and cartridges are classified by NIOSH into three classifications, N, R, and P. 
            • N class respirators/cartridges are not resistant to oil mists. 
            • R class respirators/cartridges are resistant to oil mists (less than 8 hours). 
            • P class respirators/cartridges are oil proof (>8 hours). 

            <p>Q. What does the 95 in N95 stand for? 
            <br>A. 95 refers to the efficiency of the filtration medium of the respirator or cartridge, i.e. it filters at least 95% of 0.3μm particles at 85 lpm. The percent efficiency is also equal to 100% minus leakage. Thus, an N95 has 5% leakage. Respirators/cartridges are available in other particle efficiencies such as 99 and 100. 

            <p>Q. Can the N95 respirator filter small particles? 
            <br>A. Yes. The N95 respirator can filter particles less than 0.3μm as well as particles above 0.3μm. The N95 is least efficient against particles in the 0.3μm size range. 

            <p>Q. What is the difference between an N95 respirator and a surgical mask? 
            <br>A. There are a number of differences: 
            o Surgical masks are primarily designed to prevent biological particles from being expelled by the wearer into the environment. 
            o Surgical masks are also used to protect the wearer from droplet transmission. 
            o An N95 is designed to protect the wearer from inhalation hazards, i.e. particles less than 5 μm in size such as droplet nuclei. 

            <p>Q. When should I wear an N95 respirator? 
            <br>A. N95 respirators should be worn if:
            o When exposed to airborne particles, and all TB-infected individuals (not just MDR or XDR)
            o During patient care procedures with patient with known or suspected TB infections 
            o During high-risk procedures - procedures where there is aerosol-generating procedure, such as bronchoscopy, autopsy, intubation, sputum induction, lab procedures  )



            Q: How do I take care of my respirator?
            A: The manufacturer’s instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintain the respirator should be followed to ensure that it functions properly. Cleaning, inspection, repair and store age functions may be assigned to each individual user or a central office 

            Q:  How long can I wear a filtering facepiece respirator?
            A:   A respirator should be discarded when it becomes damaged or deformed; no longer forms an effective seal to the face; becomes wet or visibly dirty; breathing through it becomes more difficult; or if it becomes contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids.

            <p>Q. What types of respirators need to be fit tested and fit checked (user seal check)?
            <br>A. Any tight-fitting respirator in use unless being used on voluntary basis, whether it is disposable or reusable. This means respirators that contact the skin to form a seal must be fit tested and fit checked (user seal check).
             
            <p>Q. What is the difference between a fit test and a user seal check (fit check)?
            <br>A. Both check and verify that the seal between the mask and skin is maintained, however, the procedures, who administers the test and circumstances when each is used differ. The procedures are detailed earlier in this Quick Tip. The employer is responsible for administering the fit test, and it is done by someone other than the user of the respirator. The user of the respirator performs the user seal check (fit check). The circumstances for performing a fit test are defined by OSHA: prior to first issue of a respirator, when there’s a change in the model, style or size of respirator used, when there’s a physical facial change in the person wearing the mask, and at least annually. The user seal check (fit check) is done each time the mask is put on, even if this occurs several times per day.
             
            <p>Q.  How frequently id fit testing  required. 
            <br>A: If testing should be done annually or whenever there has been a change in  facial features , weight gain or loss, or a new type respirator is provided. 

            <p>Q. Do all  N95s fit the same? 
            <br>A: N95s come in many shapes and sizes. Thus, each worker/user should be fit tested on the respirator provided use. 

            <p>Q.  Does facial hair interfere with the face seal?   
            <br>A:  Facial hair has the potential to break the seal between a tight-fitting respirator and face and is therefore unacceptable.
