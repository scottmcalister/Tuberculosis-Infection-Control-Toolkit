      <h1>Respiratory Protection Module</h1><br>
      <h3>Staff Education and Training</h3><br>
      <p>All HCWs should be provided periodic education and training on: indications for respiratory protection, how to put on and remove a respirator, proper use & limitations of respirators, how to perform a seal check, respirator maintenance, and storage.</p>
      <h5><b>1. Respirator Use and Reuse</b></h5>
      <p>a) <u>Respirator Use:</u> N95 respirators should be worn:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During contact with patients with known or suspected TB</li>
        <li>During high-risk procedures where aersolizes are likely to be generated such as sputum induction, intubation, bronchoscopy, autosies, and laboratory procedures</li>
        <li>For more useful information, please follow this link: <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/ohb/Documents/HCResp-ATD-RespSelectGuide.pdf">Respiratory Selection Guide</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>b) <u>Reuse of Respirators:</u>
      N95 respirators are disposable, single-use devices.  However, N95 respirators is often reused especially in low-resource settings.  If respirators are reused within the facility, there should be clear written procedures for doing so safely and effectively.</p><br>
      <p>There is no defined or uniformly accepted number of safe reuses of N95 respirators. Safe reuse of N95 respirators depends highly on proper function, prevention of contamination over time, and maintaining proper its fit and function. Rather, the maximum length of continuous use in non-dusty healthcare workplaces is typically dictated by hygienic concerns (e.g., the respirator was discarded because it became contaminated) or practical considerations (e.g., need to use the restroom, meal breaks, etc.), rather than a pre-determined number of hours. There also should be written procedures regarding using respirators for extended periods of time.</p>
      <p>Some manufacturers may provide specific guidance regarding reuse of their respirators; RPAs should consult with the manufacturer to determine the recommended maximum number of uses for the N95 respirator model(s) used in the facility to reduce the chance of decreased protection from a loss of respirator functionality. If no manufacturer guidance is available, preliminary data suggests limiting the number of reuses to no more than five uses per device to ensure an adequate safety margin (ref). RPAs should also consider additional training and/or reminders for users to reinforce the need for proper respirator donning techniques including inspection of the device for physical damage (e.g., stretched out straps, broken nosepiece, etc. Healthcare facilities should provide staff clearly written procedures to follow the employer’s maximum number of donnings (or up to five if the manufacturer does not provide a recommendation) and recommended inspection procedures.</p>
      <p>When a respirator is reused, the wearer should ensure that the respirator maintains its fit and function. However, respirators should be discarded when contaminated with blood or other bodily fluids, visibly dirty, . To minimize soiling or contamination of a respirator, sometimes the respirator is covered with a cleanable face shield or surgical mask.   Hand hygiene should be performed before and after touching and adjusting respirators. </p><br>
      <h5><b>2. Seal Checks</b></h5>
      <p>Seal checks should be done by a HCW each time the respirator is put on in order to ensure that an adequate face seal is achieved and maintained during use.  However, seal checks should not be used as a substitute for fit testing.</p>
      <p>There are specific instructions from manufacturers for properly conducting a respirator seal check which may be used instead of a positive and/or negative pressure check if the manufacturer procedures are shown to be equally effective.  A respirator seal check should include positive and negative pressure checks.   An instructional video of how to conduct a proper seal check procedures is available at (link to video) . If air leaks around the wearer’s nose, the  metal nose clip should be tightened as necessary. If a leak is detected between the face and face seal of the respirator (i.e. if the wearer can feel air moving through the seal), this indicates that the respirator does not fit properly and the respirator should be readjusted and the seal check repeated until there are no air leaks. If a proper seal cannot be demonstrated, the respirator can not be considered able to provide protection against inhalation of airborne particles and the worker should not enter a potentially contaminated area or engage in high risk procedures. In these instances, the HCW should notify his/her supervisor and/or contact the RPA.</p><br>
      <h5><b>3. Maintenance and Storage</b></h5>
      <p>Proper respirator maintenance is essential to ensuring the respirator’s effectiveness. Alterations of the N95 will impact the ability of the respirator to provide the necessary level of protection. Each time a respirator is used, it should first be visually inspected for cleanliness and proper fit routinely before and after each use. Respirators should also be stored appropriately to protect against dust, sunlight, heat, extreme cold, excessive moisture, or damaging chemicals.  Respirators will be stored on carts outside patient rooms, at nurses’ stations, and other easily accessible areas. [Reusable] respirators that are assigned to individual users will be stored in a zip-lock plastic bag labeled with the user’s name.  Other storage methods such as a plastic container can be used, but the respirator should be kept in a clean environment where it will not be damaged, deformed or contaminated (e.g., employee locker, nurses’ station, etc.); any respirator that is obviously damaged or becomes hard to breathe through should be discarded To minimize potential cross-contamination, respirators should be stored so that they do not touch each other, and the person using the respirator is clearly identified to reduce likelihood of accidental usage of another person’s respirator. Storage containers should be disposed of or cleaned regularly. Secondary exposures can occur from respirator reuse if respirators are shared among users and at least one of the users is infectious (symptomatic or asymptomatic).</p>
